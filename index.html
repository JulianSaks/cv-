          My name is King Julio - 3rd King of Egypt. My cousin loved calling me Julio when I was younger so I decided to make it official. I have visted Madagascar many times. Shoutout to Alex and the gang! Oh and btw, I am currently the head of finance at
          tx blockchain, looking to be involved in a new web 3 devleper toolkit with <strong> no downtime </strong> which will basically allow web 2 devs to seamessly transfer their apps onto the blockchain. It is called <a href="https://three0.umso.co">three0</a>. I am involved in two
          explorative ventures that hopefully will come to fruition soon: a mining operation and a casual $100M VC blokchain focused fund. Funny enough, I just started my first web full stack dev course last night!! 55 hrs of content in under a month lfg, down to 52 (currently
          working on it now which lead me to write a web page about myself... seems a bit narcasistic if you'd ask me but anyways here I am). Exciting times ahead!
